  <center><div class="featured_article_subtitle">Oliver Walter - 1/21/2017</div></center>
  <br />
  <center><div class="featured_article_body">The news headlines are dominated by hard power. Whether it is American airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, NATO buildup on the Russian border, or bombings throughout the world. We live in a time when soft power is ignored, perhaps forgotten, under the pressing weight of other violence and political instability. This may be why China’s One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative is so smart.</div></center>
  <br />
  <center><div class="featured_article_body">OBOR is an investment program designed to extend Chinese soft power throughout Central Asia, Africa, the Middle East, South America, and Europe. The project takes many forms: infrastructure development, heavy spending, and diplomatic cooperation. The project involves nearly 65 countries, 4.4 billion people, and 65% of the world’s GDP<sub>1</sub>. Not only is the project big in scale, but it is also big in spending. The Chinese government is spending an estimated $40 billion<sub>2</sub>. While the project has many priorities, the main goal is to exert Chinese influence into untouched regions.</div></center>
  <br />
  <center><div class="featured_article_body">One of these such regions is Central Asia, with some of the largest reserves of oil in the world. China understands that the Middle East will continue to be a hotbed of violence, political instability, and foreign involvement, all of which have a negative impact on the economic landscape of a region. China has developed extensive oil and gas infrastructure with Kazakhstan. This has resulted in Chinese companies owning nearly a quarter of the Kazakhstan's oil production and a half of its natural gas<sub>3</sub>. China isn’t only there for oil, they are there for influence too. Since China moved in, trade between China and Central Asia has amounted to $50 billion, far above Central Asia’s trade with Russia which amounts to only $30 billion<sub>4</sub>. This is a prime example of how OBOR’s projection of Chinese soft power can undercut the influence of neighbouring countries like Russia.</div></center>
  <br />
  <center><div class="featured_article_body">Perhaps most importantly, OBOR helps to open diplomatic channels with otherwise disconnected countries. This project, however economic in nature, is also a power play on China’s part. China recognizes that a weaker Europe and occupied America presents a rare opportunity to exert influence in otherwise hostile regions. To go ahead with many of the large construction projects the project requires, China has needed to sign agreements with nations like Hungary, Iran, and Turkey<sub>6</sub>. China is taking advantage of nations that are moving further from the west, especially in Europe. China has done heavy investment in European nations with eurosceptic governments like Poland and Hungary. This allows China to be seen favorably and as an alternative to the EU for trade, investment, and most importantly, jobs. Hungary has an unemployment rate of 7.7% (2014)<sub>7</sub> while Poland has an unemployment rate of 9% (2014)<sub>8</sub>. Since the European economy has slowed, unemployment is a major issue that OBOR can help fix. China isn’t only courting nations in Europe, they are upending traditional alliances in their own backyard. By promoting growth in countries traditionally allied to the US, China is able to offer a “tempting alternative” to US power and the “stringent standards and requirements” that come along with it.<sub>9</sub></div></center>
  <br />
  <center><div class="featured_article_body">OBOR will create new connections between China and the west, tilt the geopolitical landscape of the Asia-Pacific into China’s favor, and relieve the Chinese economy of oversupply in a meaningful and strategic way. Whether the project is successful and cost-effective in the long run is anyone’s guess, but the concept of soft power as a way to increase influence in an ever more competitive political and economic world is not lost and should continue to be a priority of all governments.</div></center>
