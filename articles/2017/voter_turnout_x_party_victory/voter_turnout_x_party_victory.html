  <center><div class="featured_article_body">The presidential race definitely shows that higher turnout generally leads to a Democratic victory. A big spike is the election of 1992 with the victory of Bill Clinton and Al Gore. But even though Clinton and Gore were reelected the next election, they were reelected with a much lower voter turnout showing just how volatile turnout can be. The graph also exposes how voter turnout has fallen since the 1960s and early 1970s.</div></center>

  <center><div class="featured_article_body">Unlike the presidential graph, higher voter turnout doesnâ€™t always equate to a Democratic victory. When thinking about victory, it is important to remember that the party which holds the majority may not have been the biggest seat gainer in that particular election. Also, elections in the house are more partisan because of how many districts there are. In a presidential race, you can only choose between two canidates who realistically represent your views. In a house election, candidates are much more localised with changes what parties people vote for. But similar to the previous graph, voter turnout has decreased rapidly since the 1960s and early 1970s.</div></center>
