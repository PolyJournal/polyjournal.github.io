He talks about the Nordic Model and Swedish politics and government.

Whether it is American airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, NATO buildup on the Russian border, or bombings throughout the world. We live in a time when soft power is ignored, perhaps forgotten, under the pressing weight of other violence and political instability. This may be why China’s One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative is so smart. <a href="/polyjournal.github.io/articles/2017/chinas_one_belt_one_road_is_genius/chinas_one_belt_one_road_is_genius.html">Read more</a></div></center>
